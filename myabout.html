<h3> ABOUT ME </h3> 

<p>Hi, I'm Nivz! I'm a sixteen years old, Tamil, self-taught artist based in London, England. 
<br />
<br />
<img src="About/babyme.jpg" style="width:100%;max-width:1000px" class="w3-margin-top">
<p><strong>Baby me</strong></p>
<br />
I like to produce artwork that shines light on issues as well as art that empowers communities, particularly the BAME and any oppressed community. 
<br />
<br />
All the *profits I make from my art go to charity. A cause really personal to me is the struggles my people have faced: the Eelam Tamil community, our Freedom Fighters and other minorities in the hands of the genocidal Sri Lankan state. So, with my art I want to make money to give back to the people who are still struggling - the unheard voices, struggling under the oppressive state and from the effects of the continuing genocide. 
<br />
<br />
<small>
*Profits are the money made from the artwork discluding the cost of the art supplies - I will only take into account the cost of the material painted on, eg. Canvases, and not the cost of the paints itself.
