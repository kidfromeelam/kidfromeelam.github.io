                        <p> Money goes to helping individuals/families affected by the civil war/current oppression through eg. buying farm animals, funding for a child’s education, cycles for journeys to school, etc. Here I have added two charity organisations of many:

                        <h3>World Literacy Foundation</h3>
                        <small>Money donated so far: 11 </small>
                        <p> “OUR MISSION We strive to ensure that every young individual regardless of geographic location has the opportunity to acquire literacy skills to reach their full potential, succeed at school and beyond.
OUR VISION We envision a world in which every one of us can read and write, in which there is free access to education for all.“  
<br />
From 1964 to present, 56 years of ongoing conflict, that was emerged due to a combination of economic, political and social factors in the country, has detrimentally impacted the country: one of these impacts have been on children's education: 
45,000 children killed (according to national figures cited by Unicef)
2.3 million children displaced from their homes
One in three of the 7.6 million registered victims of the conflict being children
8,000 minors'  have disappeared since 1985. 
<br />
The children’s basic literacy and social skills needed to thrive in life have been attacked with devastating effect. 
<br />
To reconstruct the country and achieve long-lasting peace, it is crucial to focus on literacy which is the foundation of learning and education. The WLF has been working with Aprende Leyendo to help deliver literacy support and learning resources to children in disadvantaged communities in Manizales-Colombia who have limited or no access to education via the Dingo App which is a digital learning tool that aims to develop their literacy skills and teaches English as a second language.
