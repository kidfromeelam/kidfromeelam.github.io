<p> Hi, I'm Nivz! I'm sixteen and Tamil self-taught artist based in London, England. 
<br />
I do many art styles but my favourite is painting, where I have my own style, which other styles lack from me. I like to produce artwork that shines light on issues as well as art that empowers communities, particularly the BAME and any oppressed community. My name is 'melanin paints' as it reflects the work I do: I want to emphasise the beauty of our different colour skins with my abstract, yet graceful, paintings.
<br />
    All the *profits I make from my art go to charity. A cause really personal to me is the struggles my people have faced: the Eelam Tamil community, our Freedom Fighters and other minorities in the hands of the genocidal Sri Lankan state. 
    So, with my art I want to make money to give back to the people who are still struggling - the unheard voices, struggling under the oppressive state and from the effects of the continuing genocide. 
    The donations will help through, for examples: funding children's educations, providing food, helping struggling families of maveerars (heroes who died fighting for freedom), buying people means such as farm animals, bicycles, sewing machines, etc. in order to help them financially,
    and I hope to be able to somehow invest in inspiring those children in difficult situations through opportunities and little happy experiences. 
    I will make all donations as transparent as possible, and under <a href="charities.html"> "Charity Work" </a>, you will be able to see the impacts you have made through your purchases of my artwork. <br />
    I hope my artwork is something you look forward to recieving, as well as knowing you're helping people. To be able to order a commission, please see the guide on <a href="commissions.html"> "Commissions" </a>
    <br />
    I also make donations to other charities committed to helping more cuases, which you can view under <a href="charities.html"> "Charity Work" </a>
    <br />
 <small> *Profits are the money made from the artwork discluding the cost of the art supplies - I will only take into account the cost of the material painted on, eg. Canvases, and not the cost of the paints itself. </small>
    <br / >
If you are interested in collaborating with me (ie. models, art supply brands, activist brands, art projects) or any commissions then please send an email to melaninpaintsbusiness@gmail.com or DM @melaninpaints on instagram.
